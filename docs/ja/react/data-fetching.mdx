# Data Fetching

Whether fetching static content from a remote server or interacting with a REST API, ReactLynx applications often need to retrieve data from external sources. For example, you might want to load user posts in a social media app or fetch the latest product listings in an e-commerce application.

Lynx provides the [Fetch API](api/lynx-api/global/fetch), enabling you to make network requests. You can refer to the [Networking](guide/interaction/networking) chapter for more details. The Fetch API provided by Lynx can be used together with server state management libraries from the React ecosystem, such as [TanStack Query (React Query)](https://tanstack.com/query), to simplify data fetching and state management.

It is important to note that Lynx's Fetch API has subtle differences compared to the [Web Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). You can check the [Fetch API Reference - Compatibility](api/lynx-api/global/fetch#compatibility) section to learn more about these differences. As a result, you may need to adapt libraries from the React ecosystem to ensure compatibility. If you encounter any issues on Lynx Fetch API, you are welcome to submit feature requests or [contribute](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) to help Lynx better support the React ecosystem.

## Using TanStack Query

TanStack Query is a popular server state management library in the React ecosystem, helping developers easily manage data fetching and caching.

### Installing Dependencies

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @tanstack/react-query" />

### Example

The following example application shows how to use TanStack Query with the Fetch API in ReactLynx to fetch, display, and delete user posts provided by the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

The application first uses the [`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/reference/useQuery) hook from TanStack Query to call `fetchPosts`, fetching and displaying the first 10 posts. When the user clicks the "Delete Post 1" button, it triggers an [Optimistic Update](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/guides/optimistic-updates) using the [`useMutation`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/useMutation) hook: the post with `id` 1 is immediately removed from the list, and the `deletePost` function calls the Fetch API to send a delete request. If the request fails, the state will roll back to its original state.
