# What is ReactLynx?

ReactLynx is the official React framework for Lynx. It allows you to develop Lynx native apps with a React mental model.

With ReactLynx, you can build your UI [using JSX and React components](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui), just like you would on the web. ReactLynx turns your React code into calls to the [Lynx Engine](/guide/spec.html#engine) imperative API to render the native UI.

## Main Features

ReactLynx itself is an "idiomatic" React, but it also pioneered optimizations such as "dual-threaded React" and "JSX constant folding".

- **"Idiomatic" React**: ReactLynx is an implementation of React, under the hood it is based on [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), so it has basically the same API and behavior as React, and this consistency allows many ecosystem constructions to be reused.
- **[Dual-threaded in Mind](./thinking-in-reactlynx.mdx)**: ReactLynx follows the programming model of React, but by utilizing the **dual-threaded runtime** provided by Lynx, combined with its own programming paradigm (or rules) to achieve better performance and user experience.
  - **[Off-main-thread](/guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread) Reconciliation**: ReactLynx puts some Reconciliation logic into the background thread to reduce the amount of calculation in the main thread and improve performance.
  - **[Lifecycle under dual-thread architecture](./lifecycle.md)**: Due to the dual-thread architecture of Lynx, the lifecycle of ReactLynx is slightly different from that of traditional React in terms of calling timing.
- **JSX constant folding**: ReactLynx folds JSX constants at compile time to reduce runtime calculations.

## For React Web Developers

### Change your `import`

Since it has the same API as [`react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react), you can directly replace `react` with `@lynx-js/react`, and continue to use the React API you are familiar with.

```diff
- import { useState } from 'react';
+ import { useState } from '@lynx-js/react';
```

For a full list of APIs ReactLynx implemented, please refer to the [`@lynx-js/react` API documentation](/api/react/index.html).

### Different component sets

Unlike elements such as `div` and `span` on the Web, Lynx provides a set of native component sets, such as `view`, `text`, `image`, etc ([full list](/api/elements/built-in/view.html)).
In ReactLynx, you can [combine](/guide/ui/elements-components.html) these elements to build your native UI.

```diff
- <div className="..." />
+ <view className="..." />
```

While the naming of native components is similar to React Native, ReactLynx do have some differences:

```diff
- import {View, Text, Image} from 'react-native';
- <View style={{...}} />
+ <view style={{...}} />
```

### Different event naming

Based on Lynx, ReactLynx uses a different set of event naming than the Web (go to [Events](/guide/interaction/event-handling.html) to learn more).

<Details title="Event propagation is also different">

Lynx does not have a complete corresponding API for methods such as `e.stopPropagation()` and `e.preventDefault()` that are commonly used on the Web. But Lynx's [Event Propagation Mechanism](/guide/interaction/event-handling/event-propagation.html) allows you to implement similar functions or effects as on the Web.

</Details>

```diff
- <button onTouchStart={...} />
+ <view bindtouchstart={...} catchtouchstart={...}/>
```

### No `document` and `window`

Lynx does not yet provide `document` and `window` objects, so ReactLynx does not support these two objects either.

<Details title='No "DOM"?'>

Lynx Engine provides a set of Low Level Element APIs that allow [Framework Developers](/guide/spec.html#scripting-framework-developer) to create UI through JavaScript running in the [Main Thread](/guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread).
But this set of APIs is not open to all developers.
Lynx encourages developers to use declarative methods to build UI as much as possible,
rather than directly manipulating the DOM.
But Lynx also provides the ability to [Directly Manipulate Elements](/guide/interaction/event-handling/manipulating-element.react.html) and [Main Thread Scripts](./main-thread-script.html),
which are generally used to help developers maintain a near-native user experience when implementing some complex interactions.

</Details>

This means that you cannot use any libraries that depend on `document` or `window`.

There are basically two ways for this difference:

- Most of the time, Lynx provides the feature with a different API. For example, you can use the APIs under the `lynx` object like [`lynx.reload`](/api/lynx-api/lynx/lynx-reload.html) to replace `window.location.reload()`.
- Occasionally, Lynx does not provide the feature. You can use Lynx's [NativeModules](/guide/use-native-modules.mdx) and [Custom Elements](/guide/custom-native-component.mdx) to extend Lynx's capabilities.
