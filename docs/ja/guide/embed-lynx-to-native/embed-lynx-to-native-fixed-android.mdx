As long as the outer container constraint for LynxView is `EXACTLY`, the size of LynxView will be fixed.

For example, if you want to set a 400x200 sized LynxView:

```java
//You can directly specify the size of LynxView
parentView.addView(lynxview, new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(400, 200));

//You can also fix the parent node's size and set it to MATCH_PARENT
parentView.addView(lynxview,
   new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));

```
