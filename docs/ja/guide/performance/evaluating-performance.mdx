# Evaluating Performane

The performance of an individual page can determine users' perceptions of your application. Lynx provides the [Performance API](api/lynx-api/performance-api)
to help you monitor the status of the page and accurately measure its performance during operation.

## Evaluating User Perceived Performance

User perceived performance is a concept that measures the subjective perception of users regarding whether a page is "fast" or "slow."

When users open a page, they expect to see content as soon as possible rather than waiting on a blank screen. This highlights two fundamental principles for
improving user perceived performance: showing content early and responding quickly.

- Show Content Early: While loading a page, it is better to display dynamic loading animations (e.g., CSS or SVG animations), friendly text prompts, skeleton
  screens, or any content that helps alleviate user anxiety, rather than waiting for all data to be ready before displaying completely. This gives users the
  impression of a faster load, as they see a comprehensible interface instead of a blank screen.

- Quick Response: When user actions trigger operations that take time (such as searching or image processing), display a loading animation immediately. Although
  this doesn't change the actual completion time, it gives users the impression that the page responded timely to their actions.

Following these principles can significantly reduce the likelihood of users prematurely leaving due to perceiving the page as unusable. However, since user
perceived performance involves complex subjective experiences, it's challenging to rely on a single metric for evaluation. Instead, a comprehensive assessment
using multiple metrics provided by the [Performance API](api/lynx-api/performance-api) is necessary:

- [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/metric-fcp-entry): Time to first content rendering completion.

- [Actual First Meaningful Paint (ActualFMP)](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/metric-actual-fmp-entry): Time to rendering of truly meaningful content.

- [Time to interactive (TTI)](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/metric-tti-entry): Time until page reaches interactive state.

Based on these metrics, if your page, as shown below, can display primary content after the LoadBundle without relying on network requests or asynchronous IO for
additional user-presented data, you should focus on optimizing _FCP_ and _TTI_.

Conversely, if your page relies on external data, such as that obtained via network requests, to "truly" complete rendering, you need to
[mark Lynx Pipeline](guide/performance/timing-flag) and focus on _ActualFMP_ related to critical data and elements. At times when FCP and TTI indicate
completion, the displayed content might be meaningless, such as a loading animation or a skeleton graphic.

This also reveals that displaying real data requires additional processing time, contradicting the fundamental principles for enhancing user perceived performance.
Therefore, to improve perceived performance, the first-screen display should consist of static or preloaded content, while other content can rely on network downloads
to be shown in subsequent data updates. Although this approach increases total download volume, it dramatically enhances perceived performance by rendering meaningful
content earlier.

## Evaluating Application Runtime Performance

Page performance involves both the actual speed of the application and the speed perceived by the user. The importance of perceived speed is explained
in [Evaluating User Perceived Performance](./evaluating-performance#evaluating-user-perceived-performance). This section will introduce how Lynx evaluates
the actual runtime performance.

The actual performance of a page can be evaluated from **load** and **render**. They directly affect the interaction experience between the
user and the application. Poor performance in either aspect can lead to users abandoning the content or being unable to access it at all.

### Load

From the moment a user clicks a link to the display of a new page, an application needs to complete preparatory tasks, including initializing the page container and
preparing the [TemplateBundle](guide/spec#template-bundle).

The diagram below illustrates the initialization phases before the page display, including initialization times for the [Container](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/init-container-entry),
[LynxView](guide/spec#lynxviewâ‘ ), and [Background Thread Runtime](guide/spec#background-thread-runtime). The [Performance API](api/lynx-api/performance-api)
provides [`InitContainerEntry`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/init-container-entry), [`InitLynxviewEntry`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/init-lynxview-entry),
and [`InitBackgroundRuntimeEntry`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/init-background-runtime-entry) to describe these key moments. You can
combine these performance entries to analyze the entire initialization phase.

Although these preparations occur before the page rendering, their performance directly impacts the user experience. Slow initialization speeds can delay rendering,
causing users to wait longer to see content, subsequently perceiving poor application performance. To minimize loading time, you can leverage caching, preloading,
and pre-creation to complete these tasks in advance, ensuring immediate response to user interactions and enhancing the user experience.

### Render

After loading, the process enters the page rendering stage. This stage most directly affects how quickly users can view the page content. To manage each step precisely,
Lynx uses the Lynx pipeline to divide the rendering process into several crucial stages. The [Performance API](api/lynx-api/performance-api) provides the
[`PipelineEntry`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/pipeline-entry) interface to record and analyze the specific timing of these stages.

With `PipelineEntry`, you can access detailed timing data during the page rendering process, such as main thread script execution time, style computation time, and layout
computation time. These detailed timing metrics help identify performance bottlenecks, enabling targeted optimization efforts.

Understanding and tracking the actual performance of a page is critical for improving the user experience. By utilizing specific performance metrics, you can identify which
stages are causing delays and implement optimization strategies to ensure users see a complete, interactive page as quickly as possible. This monitoring and optimization can
significantly reduce user waiting time and enhance the overall smoothness of an application.

## Building Custom Performance Metrics

There is no single set of performance metrics can describe all situations. Different business goals mean you may need to focus on different performance metrics.
Usage of the [Performance API](api/lynx-api/performance-api) is not restricted to analyzing page performance using built-in metrics. You can flexibly combine
key moments of different [`PerformanceEntry`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry) to build a set of performance metrics tailored to your application.

For example, if you want to focus on the interval between the end of the first screen rendering and the first significant data update to optimize the speed at which
users see more and richer information. You can combine [`LoadBundleEntry`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/load-bundle-entry) and [`PipelineEntry`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/pipeline-entry)
to calculate a unique metric `waitingDuration` like the following code. This metric can help you monitor the speed of network requests, file reads, and other
behaviors, pinpointing the reasons for deteriorating page performance.
