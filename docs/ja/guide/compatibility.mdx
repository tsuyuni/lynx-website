# Compatibility

This article explains how to ensure version compatibility between [Bundle] and [Lynx Engine], and how to handle challenges that come with Lynx Engine version evolution.

## Build from Source

A simple way to ensure compatibility is to **always build the Bundle with the Host application from source**.

- Bundle can fully utilize all features of the current Lynx Engine version
- Compatibility can be fully verified during development, what you see is what you get

## Multi-version Compatibility

However, in a complex project, the relationship between Bundle and Lynx Engine is not one-to-one:

- A Bundle might run in applications with different Lynx Engine versions

- An application can run multiple Bundles maintained by different teams

In this case, you need to set the [`engineVersion`] to ensure compatibility.

:::info Engine Version
When the Bundle's [`engineVersion`] is greater than the Lynx Engine version, it will not be able to run.

For example: a Bundle with [`engineVersion`] 3.3 can run on Lynx Engine 3.3 and later versions, but cannot run on 3.2.

        E11["Version 3.4"]
        E10["Version 3.3"]
        E09["Version 3.2"]
    end
    B10 -.->|❌ Not Supported| E09

When a Bundle needs to run on multiple Lynx Engine versions, its [`engineVersion`] must be lower than all Lynx Engine versions.

When running multiple Bundles on a single Lynx Engine version, each Bundle can set different [`engineVersion`]s, but none can be greater than the Lynx Engine version.

### Version Incompatibility Handling

If you try to run a Bundle on a lower version of the Lynx Engine, a Fatal level error with code [10204](/api/errors/error-code.mdx#subcode-10204) will occur, and the rendering process will stop. This mechanism prevents potential runtime issues caused by version incompatibility.

### Configuring Engine Version

The [`engineVersion`] is a string containing two version numbers, and you can specify it in your configuration file:

```js title="lynx.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from '@lynx-js/rspeedy';
import { pluginReactLynx } from '@lynx-js/react-rsbuild-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    pluginReactLynx({
      engineVersion: '3.2',
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Upgrading Lynx Engine

As Lynx Engine evolves, new features are added and some features may be deprecated. Their compatibility is also managed by [`engineVersion`].

### New Features

Some new features **_will not_** affect existing Bundles, but if [`engineVersion`] is lower than the version where they were introduced, runtime detection is needed, for example:

```js
// Detect if `lynx.newlyAddedMethod` can be called
if (lynx.newlyAddedMethod) {
  lynx.newlyAddedMethod();
}
```

While some new features cannot run on lower versions of the Lynx Engine at all, so they will only be enabled when [`engineVersion`] is greater than or equal to the corresponding version.

### Deprecated Features

Some features may be deprecated during iteration, and their behavior may change when a higher [`engineVersion`] is set.

- If only the Lynx Engine version is upgraded without upgrading the Bundle's [`engineVersion`], there will be no compatibility issues
- If both Lynx Engine and Bundle's [`engineVersion`] are upgraded, you need to read the CHANGELOG to ensure there are no unexpected behavior changes

## Compatibility Table

Lynx provides compatibility tables for each API, built-in component, and CSS property. Here's an example for the [`gap`](/api/css/properties/gap) property:

import { LegacyCompatTable } from '@lynx';

<LegacyCompatTable metadata="css/properties/gap" />

[Bundle]: guide/spec#app-bundle-aka-template-bundle
[Lynx Engine]: guide/spec#engine
[`engineVersion`]: api/rspeedy/react-rsbuild-plugin.pluginreactlynxoptions.targetsdkversion
