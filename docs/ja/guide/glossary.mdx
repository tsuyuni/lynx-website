# Glossary

This glossary is intended to provide descriptive guidance about the meanings of technical terms commonly used in the context of Lynx development. For the latest consensus on a more formal definitions of these terms, please refer to the [Lynx Living Specification](guide/spec).

## SDK

The Lynx [Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) is a collection of tools, libraries, and APIs that enable developers to build applications for Lynx. It encapsulates two distinct layers -- one native layer: the [Engine](#engine), and one scripting (or frontend) layer: the [Framework](#framework).

### Engine

The part of the SDK that is responsible for converting Lynx pages into pixels onther screen, and provides APIs that forms [the Lynx Platform](#the-lynx-platform).

It is written as a C++ core along with platform-specific layers written in platform native languages (e.g. Objective-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android, etc.), ensuring high performance and access to underlying system resources, and needs to be integrated natively and shipped together with the host application.

### Framework

The part of the SDK that offers the runtime libraries and high-level UI programming model that enable Lynx application developers to write application logic and UI components. It is written in JavaScript and is loaded together with the application code on-demand from the file system or memory.

## The Lynx Platform

Similar to the [Web Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform), the **Lynx Platform** is the set of APIs and functionalities, e.g. [Elements](#element), [Events](#event), [Styles](#style), [Scripting Runtime Environment](#scripting-runtime-environment), etc., offered by the Lynx Engine to the scripting developers.

### Template

Template is the historical name of bundle of compiled code loaded by Lynx engine to power the execution of a Lynx page (or application).

We may investigate a better name for it in the future.

### Element

### Event

### Style

### Scripting Runtime Environment

Scripting is the process where developers program a script.

A **scripting runtime environment** is used to execute scripts with a scripting engine. In the context of Lynx, there are currently two types of scriping and so correspondingly, two types of scripting runtime environment.

### Background Thread

Background threads are threads that are not the main thread. They are used to execute background scripts.

### Main Thread

The **main thread**, or the "lynx main thread", is where Lynx processes user events and emit "paints". By default (the default threading model of Lynx), the Lynx engine uses a single thread to run main thread scripts, as well as to perform layout, paints, etc.. This means that long-running main thread scripts can block the thread, leading to an unresponsive page and a bad user experience.

### JS Thread

The word historically used to refer to the **background thread**. It is deprecated because it is not clear which thread it refers to as Lynx is now capable of running JavaScript on the main thread via **main thread scripts**.

### UI Thread

The thread corresponds to the physical thread regarded as the main thread of the underlying platform (OS). Similar to Web, the **main thread** of Lynx does not necessarily map directly to the UI thread, depending on Lynx's threading model.
