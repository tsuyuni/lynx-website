# Grid Layout

If you want a responsive layout where multiple elements are staggered both vertically and horizontally, the **grid layout** is your best choice. This layout is based on a two-dimensional grid, and it is the most powerful CSS layout on the Web.

In Lynx, the grid layout largely follows with web standards. Currently, Lynx does not support [`[line-names]`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Grid_layout_using_named_grid_lines) and [`grid-area`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-area). Please refer to the [Reference](#reference) section for supported properties.

**Here is a brief guide on using the grid layout.**

## How to Build a Grid Layout?

Before you build a grid layout, it's important first to understand the basic concepts.

### Basic Concepts

- **Grid Containers and Grid Items**

  The parent element using grid layout is called a "grid container." The children within the container that are layouted using grid layout are called "grid items".

- **Grid Lines**

  The lines that divide the grid layout are called "grid lines." Typically, x rows have x+1 horizontal grid lines, y columns have y+1 vertical grid lines, as shown in the image below with 6 horizontal and 4 vertical grid lines.

- **Grid Rows and Grid Columns**

  The spaces between two grid lines are called grid tracks. The horizontal tracks in the container are called "grid rows," and vertical tracks are called "grid columns."

- **Grid Cells**

  The intersection of rows and columns forms a grid cell.

- **Grid Areas**

  The area occupied by one or more grid cells by a grid item is called a grid area.

- **Inline Axis and Block Axis**

  As Lynx does not support [`writing-mode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode), the inline axis is horizontal, and the block axis is vertical.

### Step 1: Apply `display: grid`

To implement the grid layout, set `display: grid` on the parent element.

```css
display: grid;
```

### Step 2: Specify the Size of Rows and Columns

Once the container has the grid layout specified, define the rows and columns. The [`grid-template-columns`] property specifies each column's width, while the [`grid-template-rows`] property defines each row's height.

If `grid-template-columns` or `grid-template-rows` are not explicitly used to define dimensions, the grid layout uses [`grid-auto-columns`] and [`grid-auto-rows`] for determining column widths and row heights.

<Go

  example="layout"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/grid_size.lynx.bundle"
  defaultFile="src/grid_size/index.tsx"
  entry="src/grid_size"
/>

### Step 3: Specify Grid Gaps

Grid gap is the spacing between grid tracks. It can be indicated by [`column-gap`] for columns, [`row-gap`] for rows, or [`gap`] for both columns and rows.

<Go
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/lynx-website/assets/doc/layout/grid_gap.png"
  example="layout"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/grid_gap.lynx.bundle"
  defaultFile="src/grid_gap/index.tsx"
  entry="src/grid_gap"
/>

### Step 4: Align Grid Tracks to Inline and Block Axes

Align the grid tracks with the inline (horizontal axis) and block (vertical axis) using [`justify-content`] and [`align-content`].

<Go
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/lynx-website/assets/doc/layout/grid_axis_alignment.png"
  example="layout"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/grid_axis_alignment.lynx.bundle"
  defaultFile="src/grid_axis_alignment/index.tsx"
  entry="src/grid_axis_alignment"
/>

### Step 5: Specify the Grid Lines for Grid Items

The positions of grid items can be specified. Use [`grid-column-start`] and [`grid-column-end`] to set the columns a grid area spans, and [`grid-row-start`] and [`grid-row-end`] to define rows.

<Go
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/lynx-website/assets/doc/layout/grid_placement.png"
  example="layout"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/grid_placement.lynx.bundle"
  defaultFile="src/grid_placement/index.tsx"
  entry="src/grid_placement"
/>

### Step 6: Align Grid Items to the Grid Area

Having established the grid items' respective grid areas in previous steps, you can now use [`align-items`] and [`align-self`] to vertically align grid items to the grid area, and [`justify-items`] and [`justify-self`] to horizontally align them as well. It's notable that `align-self` and `justify-self` settings on grid items will override those set by `align-items` and `justify-items` on the container.

<Go
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/lynx-website/assets/doc/layout/grid_area_alignment.png"
  example="layout"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/grid_area_alignment.lynx.bundle"
  defaultFile="src/grid_area_alignment/index.tsx"
  entry="src/grid_area_alignment"
/>
