# PipelineEntry

`PipelineEntry` is responsible for recording performance data at key moments during the [Lynx Pipeline](guide/spec#lynx-pipeline), specifically for [Framework Rendering](guide/spec#framework-rendering) and [Pixel Pipeline](guide/spec#pixel-pipeline). It inherits from [`PerformanceEntry`](../performance-entry).

The Lynx Pipeline refers to the complete process from the trigger of rendering to the final display. This process is divided into four main parts: Load, Parse, Framework Rendering (FrameworkPipeline), and Engine Rendering (PixelPipeline).

Due to the frequent triggering of the Lynx Pipeline, the framework only records the following two cases:

1. **Lynx Pipeline marked with [`__lynx_timing_flag`](guide/performance/timing-flag)**, which generate performance data as `PipelineEntry`.
2. **Lynx Pipeline triggered by loading and executing a [TemplateBundle](api/lynx-native-api/template-bundle)**, which generate performance data as [`LoadBundleEntry`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/load-bundle-entry).

The following is the flowchart for `PipelineEntry`:

## Example

This example demonstrates how to generate and retrieve `PipelineEntry`.

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="performance-api"
  defaultFile="src/pipeline_entry/index.tsx"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/pipeline_entry.lynx.bundle"
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/lynx-website/assets/doc/pipeline-entry-demo.jpeg"
  entry="src/pipeline_entry"
  highlight="{11-21,31}"
/>

## Instance properties

### [entryType](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry#entryType)

```ts
entryType: string;
```

The type of the performance event; the value for all instances of this class is fixed as `pipeline`.

### [name](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry#name)

```ts
name: string;
```

The specific name of the performance event; used to distinguish the source of the Pipeline trigger. Possible values include:

- `loadBundle`
- `reloadBundleFromNative`
- `reloadBundleFromBts`
- `updateTriggeredByBts`
- `updateTriggeredByNative`
- `updateGlobalProps`
- `setNativeProps`

### identifier

```ts
identifier: string;
```

A marker for a particular Lynx Pipeline. It can have the following two values:

1. For Lynx Pipelines marked with `__lynx_timing_flag`, **`identifier` equals the value of `__lynx_timing_flag`**.
2. For Lynx Pipelines triggered by loading and executing a `TemplateBundle`, **`identifier` is an empty string**.

### pipelineStart

```ts
pipelineStart: number;
```

The timestamp for the start of the rendering pipeline. This timestamp is represented as a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) with three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### pipelineEnd

```ts
pipelineEnd: number;
```

The timestamp for the end of the rendering pipeline. This timestamp is represented as a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) with three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### mtsRenderStart

```ts
mtsRenderStart: number;
```

### mtsRenderEnd

```ts
mtsRenderEnd: number;
```

The timestamp for the end of executing the [main thread scripts](guide/spec#main-thread-script-or-mts) to build the Element Tree. This timestamp is represented as a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) with three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### resolveStart

```ts
resolveStart: number;
```

The timestamp for the start of calculating [Element](guide/spec#element) styles. This timestamp is represented as a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) with three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### resolveEnd

```ts
resolveEnd: number;
```

The timestamp for the end of calculating [Element](guide/spec#element) styles. This timestamp is represented as a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) with three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### layoutStart

```ts
layoutStart: number;
```

The timestamp for the start of [layout](guide/spec#layout) calculations. This timestamp is represented as a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) with three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### layoutEnd

```ts
layoutEnd: number;
```

The timestamp for the end of [layout](guide/spec#layout) calculations. This timestamp is represented as a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) with three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### paintingUiOperationExecuteStart

```ts
paintingUiOperationExecuteStart: number;
```

The timestamp for the start of executing [UI operations](guide/spec#ui-op) related to painting. This timestamp is represented as a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) with three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### paintingUiOperationExecuteEnd

```ts
paintingUiOperationExecuteEnd: number;
```

The timestamp for the end of executing [UI operations](guide/spec#ui-op) related to painting. This timestamp is represented as a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) with three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### layoutUiOperationExecuteStart

```ts
layoutUiOperationExecuteStart: number;
```
