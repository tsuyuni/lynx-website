# LoadBundleEntry

_LoadBundle_ refers to the initial screen rendering pipeline triggered by [LynxView](guide/spec#lynxview) loading and executing the [TemplateBundle](api/lynx-native-api/template-bundle). `LoadBundleEntry` is used to record the performance data of this rendering pipeline and inherits from [`PipelineEntry`](./pipeline-entry).

The LoadBundle process flowchart is as follows:

## Example

This example demonstrates how to obtain a `LoadBundleEntry`.

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="performance-api"
  defaultFile="src/load_bundle_entry/index.tsx"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/load_bundle_entry.lynx.bundle"
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/lynx-website/assets/doc/load-bundle-entry-demo.jpeg"
  entry="src/load_bundle_entry"
  highlight="{10-20}"
/>

## Instance properties

### [entryType](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry#entryType)
