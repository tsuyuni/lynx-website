# FrameworkPipelineTiming

This interface describes the performance data of key stages in [framework rendering](guide/spec#framework-rendering).

## Instance Properties

### dsl

```tsx
dsl: string;
```

A string describing the DSL type, with a default value of `reactlynx`.

### stage

```tsx
stage: string;
```

A string describing the type of framework data update process, with possible values `hydrate` and `update`. `hydrate` refers to the process of calibrating and updating [main thread](guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread) data using [background thread](guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread) data, while `update` refers to updates triggered in `useEffect`. For more information, see [ReactLynx Lifecycle](react/lifecycle).

### diffVdomStart

```tsx
diffVdomStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework starts VDom Diff on the [background thread](guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### diffVdomEnd

```tsx
diffVdomEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework ends VDom Diff on the [background thread](guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### packChangesStart

```tsx
packChangesStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework starts serializing change information on the [background thread](guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### packChangesEnd

```tsx
packChangesEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework ends serializing change information on the [background thread](guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### parseChangesStart

```tsx
parseChangesStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework starts deserializing change information on the [main thread](guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### parseChangesEnd

```tsx
parseChangesEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework ends deserializing change information on the [main thread](guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### patchChangesStart

```tsx
patchChangesStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework starts applying change information on the [main thread](guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### patchChangesEnd

```tsx
patchChangesEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework ends applying change information on the [main thread](guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### hydrateParseSnapshotStart

```tsx
hydrateParseSnapshotStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework starts deserializing [main thread](guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread) information on the [background thread](guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

:::tip
This property is only valid when `stage` is `hydrate`.

### hydrateParseSnapshotEnd

```tsx
hydrateParseSnapshotEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework ends deserializing [main thread](guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread) information on the [background thread](guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.
