# GlobalEvent

Represents a global event object, which is an array that can be passed between different elements and components, or between the client and the front end.

Developers can listen to this event based on [`GlobalEventEmitter`](../../../guide/interaction/event-handling/event-propagation.mdx#globaleventemitter).

## GlobalEvent Type

### keyboardstatuschanged

Represents the keyboard status change caused by input method focus or user operation.

```json
[
  status: ['on', 'off'],    // indicates the status of the keyboard
  height: number,           // indicates the height of the keyboard, in px
  compatHeight: number,     // indicates the height of compatible keyboards, in px
]
```

### onWindowResize

  width?: ['on', 'off'],    // indicates the width of the Lynx page after the change, in px
  height?: number,          // indicates the height of the Lynx page after the change, in px
]
```

### exposure

Indicates that a node in the exposure data source has generated exposure, that is, the visibility of the node has changed from invisible to visible.

```json
[
  {
    "exposure-id": string,      // exposure-id set on the target node
    "exposure-scene": string,   // exposure-scene set on the target node
    "sign": string,             // uid of the target node
    "dataset": object,          // "data-" field set on the target node
    //......
  },
  //......
]
```

### disexposure

Indicates that a node in the exposure data source has generated a reverse exposure, that is, the visibility of the node has changed from visible to invisible.

```json
[
  {
    "exposure-id": string,      // exposure-id set on the target node
    "exposure-scene": string,   // exposure-scene set on the target node
    "sign": string,             // uid of the target node
    "dataset": object,          // "data-" field set on the target node
