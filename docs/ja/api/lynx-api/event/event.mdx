# Event

`Event` represents the event object when the event is triggered, which contains the state information when the event is triggered. Developers can listen through the [Event Handler Property](../../../guide/interaction/event-handling/event-propagation.mdx#event-handler-property).

Lynx has many different types of event objects, all of which are directly or indirectly inherited from `Event`. `Event` itself contains properties and methods applicable to all event objects.

## `Event` type

[`TouchEvent`](./touch-event.mdx)

`TouchEvent` represents a touch event object, which describes the state change of a finger on a touch surface (such as a touch screen).

[`CustomEvent`](./custom-event.mdx)

`CustomEvent` represents a custom event object, which describes the state change of a custom component.

[`AnimationEvent`](./animation-event.mdx)

`AnimationEvent` represents an animation event object, describing the state changes of the CSS animation life cycle.

## Instance property

### type

```ts
type: string;
```

Indicates the type of event.

### timestamp

```ts
timestamp: number;
```

Indicates the timestamp when the event was generated.

### target

```ts
target: {
  id: string,
  uid: number,
  dataset: [key: string]: any,
}
```

Indicates a collection of some attribute values ​​of `element` that triggered the event.

- `id`: `element`'s `id` selector.
- `uid`: `element`'s unique identifier in Lynx Engine.
- `dataset`: A collection of custom attributes starting with [`data-`](../../elements/built-in/view.mdx#data-) on `element`.

### currentTarget

```ts
currentTarget: {
  id: string,
  uid: number,
  dataset: [key: string]: any,
}
```

A collection of attribute values ​​of `element` that listens to events.

- `id`: `element`'s `id` selector.
- `uid`: `element`'s unique identifier in Lynx Engine.
- `dataset`: A collection of custom attributes starting with [`data-`](../../elements/built-in/view.mdx#data-) on `element`.

## Instance method

### stopPropagation

```ts
stopPropagation(): void;
```

Stop bubbling and prevent the event from continuing to bubble up the touch response chain.

This method is only implemented in the [main thread script](../../../react/main-thread-script.mdx). Calling it in the [main thread script](../../../react/main-thread-script.mdx) can affect both event bubbling and event handler triggering in `JS`.

### stopImmediatePropagation

```ts
stopImmediatePropagation(): void;
```

Stop bubbling, prevent the event from continuing to bubble in the event response chain, and prevent other event handlers of the same event on the current node from being triggered.

This method is only implemented in the [main thread script](../../../react/main-thread-script.mdx). Calling it in the [main thread script](../../../react/main-thread-script.mdx) can affect both event bubbling and event handler triggering in `JS`.
