# setInterval() global function

Repeatedly calls a function or executes a code fragment with a fixed time interval between each call.

## Syntax

```typescript
setInterval(function: () => void, delay: number): number;
```

### Parameters

#### function

Functions to be called repeatedly are executed after every specified `delay` milliseconds. The first call occurs after `delay` milliseconds.

#### delay

The time interval between repeated function calls, in milliseconds.

The js thread may be frozen while the app is in the background. Therefore, the actual delay of `setInterval` may be greater than the specified value. At the same time, the duration of the js thread being frozen will still be counted in the delay of `setInterval`. In this case, the specified function will only be called once immediately after the app wakes up, even if the js thread is frozen for a number of times longer than `delay`.

### Return value

Returns a positive integer representing the ID value of the timer. This ID value can be used to cancel the timer.

The front-end code should not make any assumptions about the actual value of the returned ID.
