# clearTimeout() global function

Cancel the timer set by `setTimeout`.

## Syntax

```typescript
  clearTimeout(timerId: number): void;
```

### Parameter

#### timerId

The timer ID returned by `setTimeout`.
If the timer corresponding to this ID has already finished executing, the method will not perform any action.

** Passing in an ID value that is not returned by `setTimeout` is undefined behavior and may cause problems. **

## Example

## Notes

1. `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` have a shared pool of ID numbers, so technically `clearTimeout()` and `clearInterval()` are interchangeable. However, for clarity, you should avoid doing so.

## Compatibility
