# animate()

## Introduction

The `animate()` method of the `Element` is a shortcut for setting [CSS Animation](../../css/properties/animation.mdx) on UI elements in JavaScript.

1. Use the [getElementById](./lynx-get-element-by-id) API to find the `Element` object that needs to be animated based on its `id`.
2. Call the `animate` API on the `Element` object to achieve animation.

## Syntax

```js
animate(keyframes, options);
```

### Parameter

#### keyframes

There are **two different formats**:

1. An **array** consisting of objects that contain properties and values of multiple keyframes.

```js
element.animate(
  [
    {
      // from
      opacity: 0,
      color: '#fff',
    },
    {
      // to
      opacity: 1,
      color: '#000',
    },
  ],
  2000,
);
```

2. An **object** consisting of keys as offsets and values as keyframes.

```js
element.animate({
  '0%': {
    // from
    opacity: 0,
    color: '#fff',
  },
  '50%': {
    // 50%
    opacity: 0.5,
    color: '#aaa',
  },
  '100%': {
    // to
    opacity: 1,
    color: '#000',
  },
});
```

:::info Note
The Animate API also supports specify the Timing Function individually for each Keyframe segment.

#### options

An **object** that contains one or more properties:

| Key        | Value Type | Optional | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Default Value          |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| duration   | Number     | optional | The length of time for the animation to run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 0                      |
| delay      | Number     | optional | The length of time to wait before starting the animation.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 0                      |
| iterations | Number     | optional | The number of times the animation should repeat. You can set this to `Infinity` to make the animation loop indefinitely.                                                                                                                                             | 1                      |
| direction  | String     | optional | Whether the animation runs forwards (`normal`), backwards (`reverse`), switches direction after each iteration (`alternate`), or runs backwards and switches direction after each iteration (`alternate-reverse`). Defaults to `"normal"`.                           | `"normal"`             |
| easing     | String     | optional | The rate of the animation's change over time. Accepts an [timing-function](../../css/properties/animation-timing-function), such as `"linear"`, `"ease-in"`, or `"cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1)"`. Defaults to "linear".                                            | `"linear"`             |
| fill       | String     | optional | Dictates whether the animation's effects should be reflected by the element(s) prior to playing ("backwards"), retained after the animation has completed playing ("forwards"), or both. Defaults to "none".                                                         | `"none"`               |
| name       | String     | optional | The name of the animation, which can be used to uniquely identify it. This name appears in the [animation events](../event/animation-event#animation) parameters and is typically used to determine if a particular animation event is the one you're interested in. | An internal unique ID. |
| play-state | String     | optional | Animation motion state, which defines whether an animation is running or paused, accepts an [animation-play-state](../../css/properties/animation-play-state)                                                                                                        | running                |

:::info Note:

1. If no 'name' is specified, a unique id generated incrementally by Lynx will be used as the name every time.
1. An animation with the same 'name' cannot be triggered consecutively multiple times.

:::

### Return Value

Returns an `Animation` object.
The `Animation` object has the following methods:

| Method Name          | Description                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Animation.cancel()` | Cancels the animation and triggers the `animation cancel` event. |
| `Animation.pause()`  | Pauses the animation.                                            |
| `Animation.play()`   | Resumes the animation.                                           |

## Example

```js
let ani = lynx.getElementById('test').animate(
  [
    {
      'background-color': 'blue',
      transform: 'translateX(100px) translateY(300px) rotate(360deg)',
    },
    {
      'background-color': 'red',
      transform: 'translateX(0px) translateY(600px) rotate(0deg)',
    },
  ],
  {
    duration: 3000,
    delay: 1000,
    iterations: Infinity,
    direction: 'alternate',
    easing: 'ease-in-out',
    fill: 'both',
  },
);

// When the parameter is Object, it is strictly required to write percentages with a percent sign such as '.50' and '50' equivalents are divided by 100
let ani = lynx.getElementById('test').animate(
  {
    '0%': {
      transform: 'rotate(0deg)',
      left: '0px',
    },
    '50%': {
      // The properties of the intermediate frame can default.
      left: '30px',
    },
    '100%': {
      transform: 'rotate(225deg)',
      left: '100px',
    },
  },
  {
    duration: 3000,
    delay: 1000,
    iterations: Infinity,
    direction: 'alternate',
    easing: 'ease-in-out',
    fill: 'both',
  },
);

ani.pause();
ani.play();
ani.cancel();
```

## Animation Event

The events for the `animate()` API are the same as the [animation events](../event/animation-event#animation) for CSS animations.

## Other Infos

:::info

- Animate Api and CSS Animation will override each other, and the one that takes effect later will override the former.
- Each call to `getElementById("test").animate` will generate a new `Animation` object.
- Animate Api currently only supports the creation of one animation, and will support the creation of multiple animations in the future. So now if `getElementById("test").animate` is called multiple times for a node, the last created animation will overwrite the previous animation.
- After the animation corresponding to an `Animation` object ends, if you want to restart the same animation, you need to call `getElementById("test").animate` again to create a new `Animation` object.
- Animate API currently only supports getElementById API, and the support for SelectQuery API is still being accessed.

:::

:::tip

The Animate API may not take effect, possibly because `getElementById` failed to select the node:

- The ID selector might be incorrect
- The value of the ID selector might depend on a complex JS expression, causing the value of the ID selector not to be available on the first screen. In this case, if getElementById is invoked too early (like in ComponentDidMount), it might not find the node.
