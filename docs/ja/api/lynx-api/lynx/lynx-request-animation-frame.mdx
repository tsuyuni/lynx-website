# requestAnimationFrame()

Invoke the specified callback function at the next VSYNC.

`requestAnimationFrame` is typically used in scenarios where you want to achieve animation effects by modifying element attributes in each frame.
Note that `requestAnimationFrame` will only take effect in the next frame; if you want it to continue to take effect, you need to nest `requestAnimationFrame`.

## Syntax

```ts
requestAnimationFrame: (callback: (timeStamp: number) => void) => number;
```

### Parameters

#### callback

The callback function that needs to be called at the next VSYNC.
The callback function has one parameter `timeStamp`, which is the moment when the callback function starts to execute.

### Return Value

An integer type id, used to cancel this `requestAnimationFrame` callback.

## Examples

Print the frame rate in the console:

// Todo add example later
