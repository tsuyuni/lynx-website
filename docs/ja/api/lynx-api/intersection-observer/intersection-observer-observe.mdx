# IntersectionObserver: observe() method

`observe` specifies the target node and callback, and the target node is specified according to `id`.

## grammar

```ts
observe(selector: string, callback: Function): void;
```

### Parameters

#### selector

```ts
selector: string;
```

Specify the id used when searching for the target node. The `id` will be searched first in the `component` passed in when creating the `IntersectionObserver` object. If not found, the global search will be performed. If the global search is not found, the specification will be invalid.

#### callback

```ts
callback: (res) => {};
```

Specify the callback triggered when the intersection status of the target node and the reference node changes.
The format of the callback parameter `res` is as follows:

```ts
{
     "isIntersecting": boolean, // Whether the target node intersects with the reference node
     "intersectionRatio": number, // The intersection ratio between the target node and the reference node
     "intersectionRect": object, // The intersection area between the target node and the reference node
     "boundingClientRect": object, // The intersection area of the target node
     "relativeRect": object, // The intersection area of the reference node
     "observerId": string, // The id of the target node
     "time": number, // timestamp during intersection detection (not implemented, now returns are all 0)
}
```

The structures of `intersectionRect`, `boundingClientRect` and `relativeRect` are the same. The coordinate systems are all relative to `LynxView`, that is, the upper left corner of `LynxView` is the origin of the coordinate system, with the horizontal direction to the right being the positive direction of the `x`-axis, and the vertical direction being downwards being the positive direction of the `y`-axis:

```ts
{
     "left": number | 0, // left boundary of the intersection area
     "right": number | 0, // Right boundary of the intersection area
     "top": number | 0, // The upper boundary of the intersection area
     "bottom": number | 0, // The lower boundary of the intersection area
}
```

### return value

None (`undefined`).
