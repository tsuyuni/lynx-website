# SelectorQuery: selectAll() method

Select all nodes that match the specified CSS selector under the root node specified by `SelectorQuery`.

## Syntax

```ts
selectAll(selector: string): NodesRef;
```

### Parameters

#### selector

CSS selector combination used for matching nodes. All nodes that match the specified selector combination will be returned.

The CSS selector used for matching nodes must be [CSS selectors supported by `select()`](./selector-query-select.mdx#selector).

### Return Value

A `NodesRef` object instance representing this query result.

Please note that at this time, `SelectorQuery` will only save the query parameters provided by the user in the `NodesRef` object and will not execute the query immediately. Therefore, it is **NOT feasible** to view node information or determine whether the node can be found in the following way:

```js
let nodesRef = lynx.createSelectorQuery().selectAll('#the-id');
console.log(nodesRef); // always returning a valid NodesRef object
```

## Notices

### Do not use special characters other than numbers, letters, hyphens, and underscores in the id

Special characters may be parsed as part of a CSS selector or combinator.

For example, `selectAll('#m.x')` will be parsed as looking for elements with both `id=m` and `class=x` attributes, rather than looking for an element with `id` as `m.x`.
