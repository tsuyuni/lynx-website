# SelectorQuery: select() method

Select the first node that matches the specified selector in the descendants of the root node specified in `SelectorQuery`.

## Syntax

```ts
select(selector: string): NodesRef;
```

### Parameters

#### selector

CSS selector combination used for matching nodes. The first node that matches the specified selector combination will be returned.

The CSS selector used for matching nodes must satisfy the following syntax:

##### Selectors

- Id selector `#`

```tsx
// '#my-id'
<view id="my-id" />
```

- Class selector `.`

```tsx
// '.class1'
<view className="class1" />
```

- Tag selector `tag`

```tsx
// 'view'
<view />
```

- Attribute selector (The `props` of a custom component do not belong to `attribute`, therefore the `attribute` selector cannot be used to match the `props` of a custom component.)
- `[attribute]`: Represents elements with an attribute name of attr.
- `[attribute=value]`: Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is exactly value.
- `[attribute*=value]`: Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value contains at least one occurrence of value within the string.
- `[attribute^=value]`: Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is prefixed (preceded) by value.
- `[attribute$=value]`: Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is suffixed (followed) by value.

```tsx
// '[src]'
// '[src=xxx]'
// '[data-x]'
// '[data-x=xxx]'
<image src="xxx" data-x="xxx" />
```

- The free combination of the above selectors

```tsx
// 'image#my-id[src=xxx].class1.class2'
<image id="my-id" className="class1 class2" src="xxx" data-x="xxx" />
```

##### Combinators

- Child Element Combinator `>`

  - Search for the direct child nodes of the parent node.

```tsx
// '.the-parent > .the-child'
<view className="the-parent">
  <view className="the-child" />
</view>
```

- Descendant combinator ` ` (space)

  - Search for the descendant nodes of the parent node.

```tsx
// GOOD: '.the-ancestor   .the-descendant'
// BAD:  '.the-ancestor > .the-descendant'
<view className="the-ancestor">
  <view>
    <view className="the-descendant" />
  </view>
</view>
```

- The union of multiple selectors `,`

```tsx
#id1, #id2;
```

### Return Value

A `NodesRef` object instance representing this query result.

Please note that at this time, `SelectorQuery` will only save the query parameters provided by the user in the `NodesRef` object and will not execute the query immediately. Therefore, it is **NOT feasible** to view node information or determine whether the node can be found in the following way:

```js
let nodesRef = lynx.createSelectorQuery().select('#the-id');
console.log(nodesRef); // always returning a valid NodesRef object
```

## Notices

### Do not use special characters other than numbers, letters, hyphens, and underscores in the id

Special characters may be parsed as part of a CSS selector or combinator.

For example, `select('#m.x')` will be parsed as looking for elements with both `id=m` and `class=x` attributes, rather than looking for an element with `id` as `m.x`.

## Troubleshooting

Element manipulations are performed **asynchronously** after [`exec()`](api/lynx-api/selector-query/selector-query-exec) is executed.
Therefore, it is not feasible to view element information or determine if an element can be found using the following methods:

```js
let nodesRef = lynx.createSelectorQuery().select('#the-id');
console.log(nodesRef); // always returning a valid NodesRef object
```

The correct approach is to examine the error information returned by the node operation functions invoked by the user.

### Common Error Code Definitions

```jsx
enum ErrorCode {
  SUCCESS = 0,
  UNKNOWN = 1,
  NODE_NOT_FOUND = 2,          // Node not found in the element tree
  METHOD_NOT_FOUND = 3,        // The specified method is not present on the found UI node
  PARAM_INVALID = 4,           // Invalid arguments as determined by the component implementer
  SELECTOR_NOT_SUPPORTED = 5,  // Usage of unsupported selectors
  NO_UI_FOR_NODE = 6,          // Node found in the element tree, but there is no corresponding UI
}
```

### Error Code 2 with the message "no node found for selector"

Common reasons include:

- An incorrect CSS selector was used;
- The node has not been rendered at the time of the node search.

#### Node Has Not Been Rendered at the Time of the Node Search

A common situation where a node cannot be found is when the node has not been rendered at the time the [`exec()`](api/lynx-api/selector-query/selector-query-exec) function is called, such as when the node is within a conditional statement that is not satisfied.

For example, in the pseudocode below, during the initial render, since `show` is `false`, the `<view id="xxx" />` node will not be rendered. Therefore, attempting to obtain the node in `useEffect()` will fail.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from '@lynx-js/react';

function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    lynx
      .createSelectorQuery()
      .select('#xxx')
      .invoke({
        /** Args */
      })
      .exec();
  }, []);

  return show ? <view id="xxx" /> : null;
}
```

### Error Code 3

The specified node was found, but it does not have the corresponding UI method. Check:

- Whether the node indeed has the corresponding UI method.
- If the method name is spelled correctly.
- Whether there is another node with the same name, leading to the actual search finding a different node.

### Error Code 6

The target node exists in the element tree but lacks an actual UI node.
This issue usually occurs with `view` nodes because, for performance reasons, lynx may have optimized the node internally and not actually created it at the UI layer.
If you want to prevent this optimization, try adding an `id` to the target node.
