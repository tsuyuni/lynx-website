# Performance APIs

The Performance API is a set of tools for precisely measuring the performance of Lynx applications, helping developers pinpoint bottlenecks in critical phases such
as loading, rendering, and user interactions.

## Concepts and usage

Lynx applications aim to maintain fast response times during key stages such as page loading, element rendering, and user interactions. To achieve this, the
Performance API provides many built-in metrics to describe the key moments during page rendering, assisting developers in enhancing page performance. Understanding
the following core concepts is helpful for using these APIs:

- Entry Object

  [`lynx.performance`](api/lynx-api/lynx/lynx-performance) serves as the entry point to the performance monitoring system. This object can be used to create
  performance observers. It is only accessible in in the [background thread runtime](guide/spec#background-thread-runtime).

- Performance Observer

  The [`PerformanceObserver`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-observer) interface is used to listen for various types of performance entries.

- Performance Events

  Performance events are represented by [`PerformanceEntry`](api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry). `PerformanceEntry` includes basic information such as
  the event name `name` and event type `entryType`. All performance events (e.g., application initialization time, page load time) inherit from the `PerformanceEntry`
  interface and extend it with additional properties.
