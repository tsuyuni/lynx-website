# `<time>`

The `<time>` CSS data type represents a time value expressed in seconds or milliseconds. It is used in `animation`, `transition`, and related properties.

## Syntax

The `<time>` data type consists of a `<number>` followed by one of the units listed below. Optionally, it may be preceded by a single `+` or `-` sign. As with all dimensions, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.

### Units

- `s` Represents a time in seconds. Examples: `0s`, `1.5s`, `-60s`.

- `ms` Represents a time in milliseconds. Examples: `0ms`, `150.25ms`, `-60000ms`.

## Examples

### Valid times

```
12s         Positive integer
-456ms      Negative integer
4.3ms       Non-integer
14mS        The unit is case-insensitive, although capital letters are not recommended.
+0s         Zero with a leading + and a unit
-0ms        Zero with a leading - and a unit
```

### Invalid times

```
0           Although unitless zero is allowed for <length>s, it's invalid for <time>s.
12.0        This is a <number>, not a <time>, because it's missing a unit.
7 ms        No space is allowed between the number and the unit.
```
