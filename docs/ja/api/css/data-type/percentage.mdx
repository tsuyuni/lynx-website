# `<percentage>`

The `<percentage>` CSS data type represents a percentage value. It is often used to define a size as relative to an element's parent object. Numerous properties can use percentages, such as width, height, margin, padding, and font-size.

The `<percentage>` data type consists of a [`<number>`](./number.mdx) followed by the percentage sign (%). As with all CSS dimensions, there is no space between the symbol and the number.

## Examples

```tsx
<view>
  <text style={{ width: '50%', marginLeft: '20%', backgroundColor: '#00FF00' }}>
    Width: 50%, Left margin: 20%
  </text>
  <text style={{ width: '30%', marginLeft: '60%', backgroundColor: '#FF0000' }}>
    Width: 30%, Left margin: 60%
  </text>
</view>
```
