# `<string>`

The `<string>` CSS data type represents a sequence of characters.

## Syntax

The `<string>` data type is composed of any number of [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) characters surrounded by either double (`"`) or single (`'`) quotes.

Most characters can be represented literally. All characters can also be represented with their respective [Unicode code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Code_point_planes_and_blocks) in hexadecimal, in which case they are preceded by a backslash (`\`). For example, `\22` represents a double quote, `\27` a single quote (`'`), and `\A9` the copyright symbol (`Â©`).

Importantly, certain characters which would otherwise be invalid can be escaped with a backslash. These include double quotes when used inside a double-quoted string, single quotes when used inside a single-quoted string, and the backslash itself. For example, `\\` will create a single backslash.

To output new lines, you must escape them with a line feed character such as `\A` or `\00000A`. In your code, however, strings can span multiple lines, in which case each new line must be escaped with a `\` as the last character of the line.

## Examples

```css
/* Simple strings */
"This string is demarcated by double quotes."
'This string is demarcated by single quotes.'

/* Character escaping */
"This is a string with \" an escaped double quote."
"This string also has \22 an escaped double quote."
'This is a string with \' an escaped single quote.'
'This string also has \27 an escaped single quote.'
"This is a string with \\ an escaped backslash."
```
