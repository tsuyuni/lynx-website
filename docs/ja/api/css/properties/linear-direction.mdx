## Introduction

The `linear-direction` CSS property sets how linear items are placed in the linear container defining the main axis and the direction.

Note that the values `row`, `row-reverse` are affected by the directionality of the linear container. If its [`dir`](./direction.html) attribute is `ltr`, `row` represents the horizontal axis oriented from the left to the right, and `row-reverse` from the right to the left; if the `dir` attribute is `rtl`, `row` represents the axis oriented from the right to the left, and `row-reverse` from the left to the right.

:::info
`linear-orientation` is deprecated, will be removed in the future.

import { Go } from '@lynx';

## Syntax

```css
linear-direction: column;

/* Like <column>, but reversed */
linear-direction: column-reverse;

linear-direction: row;

/* Like <row>, but reversed */
linear-direction: row-reverse;
```

### Values

- `column`

  **Default value**. The linear container's main-axis is defined to be the same as vertical direction.

- `row`

  The linear container's main-axis is defined to be the same as the text direction. The main-start and main-end points are the same as the content direction.

- `column-reverse`

  Behaves the same as `column` but the main-start and main-end are opposite to the content direction.

- `row-reverse`

  Behaves the same as `row` but the main-start and main-end points are opposite to the content direction.

- `vertical` <Deprecated/>

- `vertical-reverse` <Deprecated/>

## Formal definition

import { PropertyDefinition } from '@/components/PropertyDefinition';

<PropertyDefinition
  initialValue={<>column</>}
  appliesTo={<>linear containers</>}
  inherited="no"
/>

## Formal syntax

linear-direction = column | row | column-reverse | row-reverse
```
