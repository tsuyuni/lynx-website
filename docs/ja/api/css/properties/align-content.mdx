## Introduction

In [flexible box layout](guide/ui/layout/flexible-box-layout.mdx), the `align-content` property defines how flex lines are aligned along the **cross-axis**.

In [grid layout](guide/ui/layout/grid-layout.mdx), the `align-content` property defines how to align grid tracks along the **block axis**.

## Examples

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="css-api"
  defaultFile="src/align-content/App.tsx"
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/lynx-website/assets/doc/css/align-content.jpg"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/align-content.lynx.bundle"
  entry="src/align-content"
/>

## Syntax

### Values

#### `stretch`

**Default value**. If the combined size of the items along the cross axis (block axis in grid layout) is less than the size of the alignment container, any auto-sized items have their size increased equally (not proportionally), while still respecting the constraints imposed by [`max-height`](./max-height.mdx)/[`max-width`](./max-width.mdx) (or equivalent functionality), so that the combined size exactly fills the alignment container along the cross axis (block axis in grid layout).

#### `start`

All lines are packed starting from the start edge of the container.

#### `end`

All lines are packed starting from the end edge of the container.

#### `flex-start`

Behaves the same as `start`. Recommended to use only in flexible box layout.

#### `flex-end`

Behaves the same as `end`. Recommended to use only in flexible box layout.

#### `center`

All lines are packed toward the center of the container. Lines are tightly packed against each other and aligned centrally within the container. The distance between the cross-axis (block axis in grid layout) start edge and the first line equals the distance between the cross-axis (block axis in grid layout) end edge and the last line.

#### `space-between`

Lines are evenly distributed in the container. The spacing between each pair of adjacent lines is equal. The cross-axis (block axis in grid layout) start edge and end edge of the container are flush with the first and last lines respectively.

#### `space-around`

Lines are evenly distributed in the container, with equal space between lines. The space between the cross-axis (block axis in grid layout) start edge and the first line, and between the cross-axis (block axis in grid layout) end edge and the last line, is half the size of the space between adjacent lines.

## Formal definition

import { PropertyDefinition } from '@/components/PropertyDefinition';

<PropertyDefinition
  initialValue={
    <>
      <code>stretch</code>
    </>
  }
  appliesTo={<>flex containers/grid containers</>}
  inherited="no"
  animatable="no"
/>

## Formal syntax

```
align-content = stretch | start | end | flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around
```

## Differences from web

[mdn: align-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/align-content)

1. `normal`, `baseline`, `first baseline`, and `last baseline` are not supported. Initial value is `stretch`.
2. `space-evenly` is not supported, will be supported in the future.
