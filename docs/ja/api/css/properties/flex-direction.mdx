## Introduction

The `flex-direction` CSS property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction.

## Examples

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="css-api"
  defaultFile="src/flex-direction/App.tsx"
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/lynx-website/assets/doc/css/flex-direction.jpg"
  entry="src/flex-direction"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/flex-direction.lynx.bundle"
/>

Note that the values `row` and `row-reverse` are affected by the directionality of the flex container. If its [`dir`](./direction.html) attribute is `ltr`, `row` represents the horizontal axis oriented from the left to the right, and `row-reverse` from the right to the left; if the `dir` attribute is `rtl`, `row` represents the axis oriented from the right to the left, and `row-reverse` from the left to the right.

## Syntax

```css
/* The direction text is laid out in a line */
flex-direction: row;

/* Like <row>, but reversed */
flex-direction: row-reverse;

/* The direction in which lines of text are stacked */
flex-direction: column;

/* Like <column>, but reversed */
flex-direction: column-reverse;
```

### Values

- `row`

  **Default value**. The flex container's main-axis is defined to be the same as the text direction. The main-start and main-end points are the same as the content direction.

- `row-reverse`

  Behaves the same as `row` but the main-start and main-end points are opposite to the content direction.

- `column`

  The flex container's main-axis is the same as the vertical. The main-start and main-end points are the same as the before and after points of the writing-mode.

- `column-reverse`

  Behaves the same as `column` but the main-start and main-end are opposite to the content direction.

## Formal definition

import { PropertyDefinition } from '@/components/PropertyDefinition';

<PropertyDefinition
  initialValue={<>row</>}
  appliesTo={<>flex containers</>}
  inherited="no"
/>

## Formal syntax

```
flex-direction =
  row             |
  row-reverse     |
  column          |
  column-reverse
```
