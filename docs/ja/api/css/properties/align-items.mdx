## Introduction

`align-items` property sets the [`align-self`](./align-self.mdx) value on all direct children as a group. In flexible box layout and [linear layout](guide/ui/layout/linear-layout.mdx), it controls the alignment of items on the **cross axis**. In grid layout, it controls the alignment of items on the **block axis** within their grid area.

For flexible box layout, if any child element's cross-axis [`margin`](./margin.mdx) is set to `auto`, `align-items` will be ignored.

:::info
For grid layout, Lynx doesn't support `writing-mode`, so the block axis is the vertical axis.

## Examples

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="css-api"
  defaultFile="src/align-items/App.tsx"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/align-items.lynx.bundle"

## Syntax

### Values

#### `stretch`

**Default value**. If items are smaller than the container in the **cross-axis** direction (block axis in [grid](guide/ui/layout/grid-layout.mdx) layout), items with unspecified dimensions (height/width) or set to `auto` will be stretched to match the height of the row or width of the column. These items still maintain their aspect ratio constraints.

#### `center`

In flex and [linear](guide/ui/layout/linear-layout.mdx) layouts, items are centered along the cross axis.

In [grid](guide/ui/layout/grid-layout.mdx) layout, items are centered along the block axis within their grid area.

:::info
In flexible box layout, if an item's cross-axis size is larger than the flex container, it will overflow equally in both directions.
:::

#### `start`

In flex and [linear](guide/ui/layout/linear-layout.mdx) layouts, items are aligned at the start of the cross axis.

In [grid](guide/ui/layout/grid-layout.mdx) layout, items are aligned with the start edge of their grid area along the block axis.

#### `end`

In flex and [linear](guide/ui/layout/linear-layout.mdx) layouts, items are aligned at the end of the cross axis.

In [grid](guide/ui/layout/grid-layout.mdx) layout, items are aligned with the end edge of their grid area along the block axis.

#### `flex-start`

Behaves the same as `start`.

#### `flex-end`

Behaves the same as `end`.

#### `baseline`

All flex items are aligned such that their flex container baselines align. The item with the largest distance between its cross-start margin edge and its baseline is flushed with the cross-start edge of the line. Currently only supported in flexible box layout.

#### `auto` <Deprecated/>

Equivalent to `stretch`. Not recommended, as this value doesn't exist in Web.

## Formal definition

import { PropertyDefinition } from '@/components/PropertyDefinition';

<PropertyDefinition
  initialValue={<>stretch</>}
  appliesTo={<>flex/grid/linear containers</>}
  inherited="no"
  animatable="no"
/>

## Formal syntax

```
align-items = stretch | center | start | end | flex-start | flex-end | baseline | auto
```

## Differences from web

[mdn: align-items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/align-items)

1. `normal`, `self-start` and `self-end` are not supported. Initial value is `stretch`.
