## Introduction

Used to set typesetting acceleration in [relative-layout](guide/ui/layout/relative-layout.mdx).
When using positioning between elements at the same level, it is recommended to enable this property, and elements at the same level will only depend upwards.

When this property is false, the relative performance is poor, and it can support the vertical direction and handle the dependencies separately in the horizontal direction.
For example, if there are 1 and 2 elements in the page, the width of 1 is determined by 2, and the height of 2 is determined by 1. In this case, if relative-layout-once is true, it cannot be processed, and relative-layout-once is false. can be handled.

## Syntax

```css
relative-layout-once: true;
relative-layout-once: false;
```

### Values

- `true`

  **Default Value**. Turn on [relative-layout](guide/ui/layout/relative-layout.mdx) acceleration.

- `false`

  Turn off [relative](guide/ui/layout/relative-layout.mdx) layout acceleration.
