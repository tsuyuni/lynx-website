- Different from Web, the Perspective property in Lynx takes effect on the current node, while in Web, the Perspective property takes effect on child nodes.
- This inconsistency is a historical legacy issue that we are currently resolving.

:::

## Introduction

The perspective CSS property determines the distance between the z=0 plane and the user in order to give a 3D-positioned element some perspective.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword value */
perspective: auto;

/* <length> values */
perspective: 20px;
perspective: 3.5em;
```

- `auto`
  Default value

- `[<length>]`
  specifies the observer's distance from the `z=0` plane

```
perspective = auto | <length [0,âˆž]>
```
