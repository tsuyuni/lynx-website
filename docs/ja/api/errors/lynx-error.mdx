# LynxError

`LynxError` is the structure used to represent an error,
carrying several properties such as code, subcode, level, and error message.
Developers can utilize the attributes and methods for troubleshooting.

## Android

#### getErrorCode

```java
public int getErrorCode()
```

Return the error code. The error code is a 3 to 4-digit number used to denote the behavior of the error. For example, code 301 indicates a loading error for image. You can refer to documentation [Error Codes](api/errors/error-code) to learn the specific behavior each error code represents.

#### getSubcode

```java
public int getSubcode()
```

Return the error subcode. The error subcode is a 5 to 6-digit number derived from extending the error code by 2 digits. The error subcode is used to indicate the cause of the error. For example, subcode 30101 indicates that the loaded image is too large. You can refer to documentation [Error Codes](api/errors/error-code) to learn the specific cause each error subcode represents.

#### isFatal

```java
public boolean isFatal()
```

Determine if the error level is `Fatal`. `LynxError` has three levels: `Fatal`, `Error`, and `Warn`. `Fatal` indicates a critical error that might cause the Lynx page to go blank, requiring the integrator to perform fallback handling; for example, attempting to reload the Lynx page or displaying an error page. `Error` denotes a non-critical error that might cause some functionalities of the Lynx page to become unavailable. `Warn` signifies a warning error that does not affect the functionality of the Lynx page but should be addressed if possible. You can refer to documentation [Error Codes](api/errors/error-code) to learn about the error levels associated with each subcode. If the level is `Undecided`, it means that the error level for that subcode is determined at runtime.

#### getMsg

```java
public boolean getMsg()
```

Return all error information in JSON string format, including the code, subcode, error message, level, and fix suggestion.

## iOS

#### errorCode

```objective-c
- (NSInteger)errorCode
```

Return the error code. The error code is a 3 to 4-digit number used to denote the behavior of the error. For example, code 301 indicates a loading error for image. You can refer to documentation [Error Codes](api/errors/error-code) to learn the specific behavior each error code represents.

#### subcode

```objective-c
- (NSInteger)subcode
```

Return the error subcode. The error subcode is a 5 to 6-digit number derived from extending the error code by 2 digits. The error subcode is used to indicate the cause of the error. For example, subcode 30101 indicates that the loaded image is too large. You can refer to documentation [Error Codes](api/errors/error-code) to learn the specific cause each error subcode represents.

#### isFatal

```objective-c
- (BOOL)isFatal
```

Determine if the error level is `Fatal`. `LynxError` has three levels: `Fatal`, `Error`, and `Warn`. `Fatal` indicates a critical error that might cause the Lynx page to go blank, requiring the integrator to perform fallback handling; for example, attempting to reload the Lynx page or displaying an error page. `Error` denotes a non-critical error that might cause some functionalities of the Lynx page to become unavailable. `Warn` signifies a warning error that does not affect the functionality of the Lynx page but should be addressed if possible. You can refer to documentation [Error Codes](api/errors/error-code) to learn about the error levels associated with each subcode. If the level is `Undecided`, it means that the error level for that subcode is determined at runtime.

#### userInfo

```objective-c
- (NSDictionary*)userInfo
```

Return an `NSDictionary` from which the error information can be queried using the key `LynxErrorUserInfoKeyMessage`. The error information is a JSON string that includes the code, subcode, error message, level, fix suggestion, etc.
