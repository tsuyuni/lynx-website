## CssModuleLocalsConvention type

The style of exported class names.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type CssModuleLocalsConvention =
  | 'asIs'
  | 'camelCase'
  | 'camelCaseOnly'
  | 'dashes'
  | 'dashesOnly';
```

## Remarks

Given the various `exportLocalsConvention` values, the behavior is described as follows:

- `'asIs'`<!-- -->: Class names will be exported as is.

- `'camelCase'`<!-- -->: Class names will be camelized, the original class name will not to be removed from the locals

- `'camelCaseOnly'`<!-- -->: Class names will be camelized, the original class name will be removed from the locals

- `'dashes'`<!-- -->: Only dashes in class names will be camelized

- `'dashesOnly'`<!-- -->: Dashes in class names will be camelized, the original class name will be removed from the locals
