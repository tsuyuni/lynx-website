# Plugin

Rsbuild provides a powerful plugin system that allows for user extension.
Rspeedy leverages this plugin system directly.

Plugins written by developers can modify the default behavior of Rspeedy/Rsbuild and add various additional features, including but not limited to:

- Register lifecycle hooks
- Transform module source code
- Modify Rsbuild configuration
- Modify Rspack configuration
