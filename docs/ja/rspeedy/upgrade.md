# Upgrade Rspeedy

This section explains how to upgrade the project's Rspeedy-related dependencies.

## Use `upgrade-rspeedy`

The Rspeedy project includes several NPM packages with `peerDependencies` constraints. Unmatched `peerDependencies` can lead to compilation and runtime errors.

We recommend using the [`upgrade-rspeedy`](https://npmjs.org/package/upgrade-rspeedy) tool to upgrade the Rspeedy version.

:::info
The `upgrade-rspeedy` command will not install dependencies for you.

Please remember to install the dependencies with your package manager.
