# Build Profiling

Performing a performance analysis can help you identify performance bottlenecks in your project, allowing for targeted optimization.

## Using Rsdoctor

Rsdoctor is a build analyser that can visually display the compilation time of each loaders and plugins.

Please refer to [Use Rsdoctor](./use-rsdoctor.mdx) for more information.

## Node.js Profiling

When Rspeedy executes a build, you can use Node.js profiling to analyze the JavaScript execution, which helps to identify performance bottlenecks.

For example, to perform the [CPU profiling](https://nodejs.org/docs/v20.17.0/api/cli.html#--cpu-prof) analysis, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
#dev
node --cpu-prof ./node_modules/@lynx-js/rspeedy/bin/rspeedy.js dev

# build
node --cpu-prof ./node_modules/@lynx-js/rspeedy/bin/rspeedy.js build
```

The above commands will generate a `*.cpuprofile` file. We can use [speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope) to visualize this file:

```bash
# Install speedscope
npm install -g speedscope

# View cpuprofile content
# Replace the name with the local file name
speedscope CPU.date.000000.00000.0.001.cpuprofile
```

## Rspack profiling

Rspeedy supports the use of the `RSPACK_PROFILE` environment variable for Rspack build performance profiling.

```bash
# dev
RSPACK_PROFILE=ALL rspeedy dev

# build
RSPACK_PROFILE=ALL rspeedy build
```

This command will generate a `rspack-profile-${timestamp}` folder in the dist folder, and it will contain `logging.json`, `trace.json` and `jscpuprofile.json` files:

- `trace.json`: The time spent on each phase of the Rust side is recorded at a granular level using tracing and can be viewed using [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).
- `jscpuprofile.json`: The time spent at each stage on the JavaScript side is recorded at a granular level using [Node.js inspector](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/inspector.html) and can be viewed using [speedscope.app](https://www.speedscope.app/).
- `logging.json`: Includes some logging information that keeps a coarse-grained record of how long each phase of the build took. (Not supported in development environment yet)
