## Introduction

The `grid-auto-flow` CSS property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works, specifying exactly how auto-placed items get flowed into the grid.

## Examples

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="css-api"
  defaultFile="src/grid-auto-flow/App.tsx"
  img="/assets/doc/css/grid-auto-flow.png"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/grid-auto-flow.lynx.bundle"
  entry="src/grid-auto-flow"
/>

## Syntax

```css
grid-auto-flow: row;
grid-auto-flow: column;
grid-auto-flow: row dense;
grid-auto-flow: column dense;
grid-auto-flow: dense;
```

### Values

This property may take one of two forms:

a single keyword: one of row, column, or dense.

two keywords: row dense or column dense.

- `row`

  **Default value**. Items are placed by filling each row in turn, adding new rows as necessary. If neither row nor column is provided, row is assumed.

- `column`

  Items are placed by filling each column in turn, adding new columns as necessary.

- `dense`

  "dense" packing algorithm attempts to fill in holes earlier in the grid, if smaller items come up later. This may cause items to appear out-of-order, when doing so would fill in holes left by larger items.

  If it is omitted, a "sparse" algorithm is used, where the placement algorithm only ever moves "forward" in the grid when placing items, never backtracking to fill holes. This ensures that all of the auto-placed items appear "in order", even if this leaves holes that could have been filled by later items.

## Formal definition

import { PropertyDefinition } from '@/components/PropertyDefinition';

<PropertyDefinition
  initialValue={<>row</>}
  appliesTo={<>grid containers</>}
  inherited="no"
/>

## Formal syntax

```
grid-auto-flow = [ row | column ] || dense
```
