## Introduction

The `right` CSS property participates in specifying the horizontal position of a positioned element. For more information, please refer to property [`position`](./position).

The effect of `right` depends on how the element is positioned (i.e., the value of the position property):

- When `position` is set to `absolute` or `fixed`, the `right` property specifies the distance between the element's outer margin of `right` edge and the inner border of the `right` edge of its containing block.

- When `position` is set to `relative`, the `right` property specifies the distance the element's `right` edge is moved to the `left` from its normal position.

When both `left` and `right` are defined, and `width` constraints don't prevent it, the element will stretch to satisfy both. If the element cannot stretch to satisfy both, the `position` of the element is overspecified. When this is the case, the `left` value has precedence when the container is left-to-right; the `right` value has precedence when the container is right-to-left.

## Examples

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="css-api"
  defaultFile="src/right/App.tsx"
  img="/assets/doc/css/right.jpg"
  entry="src/right"
  animatable="yes"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/right.lynx.bundle"
/>

## Syntax

```css
/* <length> values */
right: 3px;
right: 2rpx;
right: 2.4em;
right: 3rem;

right: 10%;

/* Keyword value */
right: auto;

/* calc */
right: calc(1px + 1px);
```

### Values

#### `auto`

**Default value**.

#### `<length>`

A negative, null, or positive [`<length>`](api/css/data-type/length.mdx) that represents:

- for absolutely positioned elements, the distance to the right edge of the containing block.

- for relatively positioned elements, the distance that the element is moved to the left of its normal position.

#### `<percentage>`

A `<percentage>` of the [containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block)'s width.

## Formal definition

import { PropertyDefinition } from '@/components/PropertyDefinition';

<PropertyDefinition
  initialValue={<>auto</>}
  appliesTo={<>all elements</>}
  inherited="no"
  percentages={<>refer to the width of the containing block</>}
/>

## Formal syntax

```
right =
  auto                 |
  <length-percentage>  |

<length-percentage> =
  <length>      |
  <percentage>
```
