## Introduction

In flex and [linear](guide/ui/layout/linear-layout.mdx) layout, `align-self` will align the elements in the current container on the **cross axis**. In grid layout, `align-self` controls the alignment of child elements along the **block axis** within their grid area, and `align-self` overrides the existing value of [`align-items`](./align-items.mdx).

For flexible box layout, if any child element's cross-axis [`margin`](./margin.mdx) is set to auto, `align-self` will be ignored.

:::info
For grid layout, Lynx doesn't support `writing-mode`, so the block axis is the vertical axis.

## Examples

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="css-api"
  defaultFile="src/align-self/App.tsx"
  img="/assets/doc/css/align-self.jpg"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/align-self.lynx.bundle"
  entry="src/align-self"
/>

## Syntax

### Values

#### `auto`

**Default value**. Aligns according to the parent's [`align-items`](./align-items.mdx) value.

#### `stretch`

If items are smaller than the container in the **cross-axis** direction (block axis in [grid](guide/ui/layout/grid-layout.mdx) layout), items with unspecified dimensions (height/width) or set to `auto` will be stretched to match the height of the row or width of the column. These items still maintain their aspect ratio constraints.

#### `center`

In flex and [linear](guide/ui/layout/linear-layout.mdx) layouts, the item is centered along the cross axis.

In [grid](guide/ui/layout/grid-layout.mdx) layout, the item is centered along the block axis within its grid area.

#### `start`

In flex and [linear](guide/ui/layout/linear-layout.mdx) layouts, the item is aligned at the start of the cross axis.

In [grid](guide/ui/layout/grid-layout.mdx) layout, the item is aligned with the start edge of its grid area along the block axis.

#### `end`

In flex and [linear](guide/ui/layout/linear-layout.mdx) layouts, the item is aligned at the end of the cross axis.

In [grid](guide/ui/layout/grid-layout.mdx) layout, the item is aligned with the end edge of its grid area along the block axis.

#### `flex-start`

Behaves the same as `start`.

#### `flex-end`

Behaves the same as `end`.

#### `baseline`

The item participates in baseline alignment. Currently only supported in flexible box layout.

## Formal definition

import { PropertyDefinition } from '@/components/PropertyDefinition';

<PropertyDefinition
  initialValue={<>auto</>}
  appliesTo={<>flex/grid/linear items</>}
  inherited="no"
/>

## Formal syntax

```
align-self = auto | center | start | end | flex-start | flex-end | baseline | stretch
```

## Differences from web

[mdn: align-self](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/align-self)

1. `normal`, `self-start` and `self-end` are not supported.
