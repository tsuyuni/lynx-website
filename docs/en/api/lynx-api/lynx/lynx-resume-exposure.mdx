# lynx: resumeExposure() static method

<RuntimeBadge type={'bts'} />

The `lynx.resumeExposure` method can be used to turn on exposure detection, that is, to restart the detection of the visibility of the target node, and subsequently trigger the exposure/anti-exposure event normally.

## grammar

```ts
resumeExposure(): void;
```

### Parameters

None (`undefined`).

### return value

None (`undefined`).

## Precautions

Calling `lynx.resumeExposure` may not trigger an exposure event. Whether or not an exposure event is triggered depends on the difference between the results of this exposure detection and the previous one. For details, please refer to [Exposure Capability](../../../guide/interaction/visibility-detection/exposure-ability.mdx).

## Compatibility

import { LegacyCompatTable } from '@lynx';
