[react](/api/react/index.mdx) / useLayoutEffect

# Function: ~~useLayoutEffect()~~

```ts
function useLayoutEffect(effect: EffectCallback, deps?: DependencyList): void
```

`useLayoutEffect` is now an alias of `useEffect`. Use `useEffect` instead.

Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code. The effects run after main thread dom update without blocking it.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `effect` | `EffectCallback` | Imperative function that can return a cleanup function |
| `deps`? | `DependencyList` | If present, effect will only activate if the values in the list change (using ===). |

## Returns

`void`

## Deprecated

`useLayoutEffect` in the background thread cannot offer the precise timing for reading layout information and synchronously re-render, which is different from React.

## Defined in

@lynx-js/react/runtime/lib/hooks/react.d.ts:15
